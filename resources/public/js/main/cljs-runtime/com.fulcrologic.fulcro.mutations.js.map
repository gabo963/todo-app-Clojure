The term mutation refers to two things:\n\n  * The literal data that stands for the operation. These are lists with a single symbol and a map of parameters. In\n  earlier version, you had to quote them: `'[(f {:x 1})]`, but Fulcro 3 includes a way to declare them so that they\n  auto-quote themselves for convenience. This can be confusing to new users. Remember that a mutation call is nothing\n  more than a *submission* of this data via `comp/transact!` (i.e. call `f` with the parameter `{:x 1}`).\n  * One or more definitions of what to do when the mutation is requested.\n\n  The former are submitted with `transact!` and can be written like so:\n\n  ```\n  ;; The unquote on the parameters is typically needed because you'll use surrounding binding values in them.\n  (let [x 3\n        some-local-value 42]\n    (comp/transact! this `[(f ~{:x x}) (g ~{:y some-local-value})]))\n  ;; or, if pre-declared and required:\n  (let [x 3\n        some-local-value 42]\n    (comp/transact! this [(f {:x x}) (g {:y some-local-value})]))\n  ```\n\n  This works because a mutation *definition* actually builds a record that response to function calls. This means\n\n  ```\n  (defn func [x] (inc x))\n  (defmutation f [params] ...)\n\n  ;; A regular function runs when called...\n  (func 3)\n  ;; => 4\n\n  ;; A mutation simply returns its expression when called:\n  (f {:x 1})\n  ;; => (f {:x 1})\n  ```\n\n  This allows you to embed a mutation expression without quoting in your calls to transact (if desired) or with\n  quoting if you have something like a circular reference problem.\n\n  See the Developer's Guide for more information.\n  \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations :refer [defmutation]]))\n  (:require\n    #?(:clj [cljs.analyzer :as ana])\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.raw.components :as rc]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.dom.events :as evt]\n    [com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core :refer [>def >defn =>]]\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]\n    [taoensso.encore :as enc]\n    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.do-not-use :as futil]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.data-targeting :as targeting]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.merge :as merge]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.lookup :as ah]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tempid :as tempid]\n    [clojure.string :as str])\n  #?(:clj\n     (:import (clojure.lang IFn))))\n\n(>def ::env (s/keys :req-un [:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/app]))\n(>def ::returning rc/component-class?)\n\n#?(:clj\n   (deftype Mutation [sym]\n     IFn\n     (invoke [this]\n       (this {}))\n     (invoke [this args]\n       (list sym args)))\n   :cljs\n   (deftype Mutation [sym]\n     IFn\n     (-invoke [this]\n       (this {}))\n     (-invoke [this args]\n       (list sym args))))\n\n(>defn update-errors-on-ui-component!\n  \"A handler for mutation network results that will place an error, if detected in env, on the data at `ref`.\n  Errors are placed at `k` (defaults to `::m/mutation-error`).\n\n  Typically used as part of the construction of a global default result handler for mutations.\n\n  Swaps against app state and returns `env`.\"\n  ([env]\n   [::env => ::env]\n   (update-errors-on-ui-component! env ::mutation-error))\n  ([env k]\n   [::env keyword? => ::env]\n   (let [{:keys [app state result ref]} env\n         remote-error?

By convention things that contain logic use names that end\n     in `action`.  The remote behavior of a mutation is defined by naming a handler after the remote.\n\n     ```\n     (defmutation boo\n       \\\"docstring\\\" [params-map]\n       (action [env] ...)\n       (my-remote [env] ...)\n       (other-remote [env] ...)\n       (remote [env] ...))\n     ```\n\n     NOTE: Every handler in the defmutation is turned into a lambda, and that lambda will be available in `env` under\n     the key `:handlers`. Thus actions and remotes can cross-call (TODO: Make the macro rewrite cross calls so they\n     can look like fn calls?):\n\n     ```\n     (defmutation boo\n       \\\"docstring\\\" [params-map]\n       (action [env] ...)\n       (ok-action [env] ...)\n       (error-action [env] ...)\n       (result-action [env] ((-> env :handlers :ok-action) env)))\n     ```\n\n     This macro normally adds a `:result-action` handler that does normal Fulcro mutation remote result logic unless\n     you supply your own. The default result-action ends up invoking either `ok-action` or `error-action`.\n\n     Remotes in Fulcro 3 are also lambdas, and are called with an `env` that contains the state as it exists *after*\n     the `:action` has run in `state`, but also include the 'before action state' as a map in `:state-before-action`.\n\n     IMPORTANT: You can fully-qualify a mutation's symbol when declaring it to force it into a custom namespace,\n     but this is highly discouraged and will require quoting when used in a mutation.\n     \"\n       :arglists\n       '([sym docstring? arglist handlers])} defmutation\n     [& args]\n     (defmutation* &env args)))\n\n(defmutation set-props\n  \"Mutation: A convenience helper, generally used 'bit twiddle' the data on a particular database table (using the component's ident).\n  Specifically, merge the given `params` into the state of the database object at the component's ident.\n  In general, it is recommended this be used for ui-only properties that have no real use outside of the component.\n  \"\n  [params]\n  (action [{:keys [state ref]}]\n    (when (nil? ref) (log/error \"m/set-props requires component to have an ident.
