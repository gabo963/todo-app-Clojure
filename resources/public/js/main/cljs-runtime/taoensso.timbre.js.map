[{\\\"*\\\"} :debug]]`.\n\n      Example `ns-pattern`s:\n        #{}, \\\"*\\\", \\\"foo.bar\\\", \\\"foo.bar.*\\\", #{\\\"foo\\\" \\\"bar.*\\\"},\n        {:allow #{\\\"foo\\\" \\\"bar.*\\\"} :deny #{\\\"foo.*.bar.*\\\"}}.\n\n    :ns-filter\n      Logging will occur only if a logging call's namespace is permitted\n      by this ns-filter. Possible values:\n\n        - Arbitrary (fn may-log-ns?

If any middleware\n      returns nil, NO dispatch will occur (i.e. the event will be filtered).\n\n      Useful for layering advanced functionality.
