Defaults to #(merge % {:status-code 500}).\n\n  The request middleware is a `(fn [request] modified-request)`. The `request` will have `:url`, `:body`, `:method`, and `:headers`. The\n  request middleware defaults to `wrap-fulcro-request` (which encodes the request in transit+json). The result of this\n  middleware chain on the outgoing request becomes the real outgoing request. It is allowed to modify the `url`.\n  If the the request middleware returns a corrupt request or throws an exception then the remote code\n  will immediately abort the request. The return value of the middleware will be used to generate a request to `:url`,\n  with `:method` (e.g. :post), and the given headers. The body will be sent as-is without further translation.\n\n  `response-middleware` is a function that returns a function `(fn [response] mod-response)` and\n  defaults to `wrap-fulcro-response` which decodes the raw response and transforms it back to a response that Fulcro can merge.\n\n  The response will be a map containing the `:outgoing-request` which is the exact request sent on the network; `:body`, which\n  is the raw data of the response. Additionally, there will be one or more of the following to indicate low-level\n  details of the result: `:status-code`, `:status-text`, `:error-code` (one of :none, :exception, :http-error, :abort, or :timeout),\n  and `:error-text`.  Middleware is allowed to morph any of this to suit its needs.\n\n  DEPRECATED: If the response middleware includes a `:transaction` key in the response with EQL, then that EQL will be\n  used in the resulting Fulcro merge steps. This can seriously screw up built-in behaviors. You are much better off ensuring\n  that your query matches the shape of the desired response in most cases.\n\n  The definition of `remote-error?` in the application will deterimine if happy-path or error handling will\n  be applied to the response.  The default setting in Fulcro will cause\n  a result with a 200 status code to cause whatever happy-path logic is configured for that specific\n  response's processing.\n  For example, see `m/default-result-action!` for mutations, and `df/internal-load` for loads. The `:body` key\n  will be considered the response to use, and the optional `:transaction` key an override to the EQL query used\n  for any merges.\n\n  See the top-level application configuration and Developer's Guide for more details.\"\n  [{:keys [url request-middleware response-middleware make-xhrio preprocess-error] :or {url                 \"/api\"\n                                                                                        response-middleware (wrap-fulcro-response)\n                                                                                        request-middleware  (wrap-fulcro-request)\n                                                                                        preprocess-error    (fn [r] (merge r {:status-code 500}))\n                                                                                        make-xhrio          make-xhrio} :as options}]\n  [(s/keys :opt-un [::url ::request-middleware ::response-middleware ::make-xhrio]) => ::fulcro-remote]\n  (merge options\n    {:active-requests    (atom {})\n     :supports-raw-body? true\n     :transmit!
