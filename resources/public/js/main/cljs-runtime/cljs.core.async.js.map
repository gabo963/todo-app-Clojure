Channels can be subscribed to\n  receive copies of topics using 'sub', and unsubscribed using\n  'unsub'. Each topic will be handled by an internal mult on a\n  dedicated channel. By default these internal channels are\n  unbuffered, but a buf-fn can be supplied which, given a topic,\n  creates a buffer with desired properties.\n\n  Each item is distributed to all subs in parallel and synchronously,\n  i.e. each sub must accept before the next item is distributed. Use\n  buffering/windowing to prevent slow subs from holding up the pub.\n\n  Items received when there are no matching subs get dropped.\n\n  Note that if buf-fns are used then each topic is handled\n  asynchronously, i.e. if a channel is subscribed to more than one\n  topic it should not expect them to be interleaved identically with\n  the source.\"\n  ([ch topic-fn] (pub ch topic-fn (constantly nil)))\n  ([ch topic-fn buf-fn]\n     (let [mults (atom {}) ;;topic->mult\n           ensure-mult (fn [topic]\n                         (or (get @mults topic)\n                             (get (swap! mults\n                                         #(if (% topic) % (assoc % topic (mult (chan (buf-fn topic))))))\n                                  topic)))\n           p (reify\n              Mux\n              (muxch* [_] ch)\n\n              Pub\n              (sub* [p topic ch close?]\n                    (let [m (ensure-mult topic)]\n                      (tap m ch close?)))\n              (unsub* [p topic ch]\n                      (when-let [m (get @mults topic)]\n                        (untap m ch)))\n              (unsub-all* [_] (reset! mults {}))\n              (unsub-all* [_ topic] (swap! mults dissoc topic)))]\n       (go-loop []\n         (let [val (<! ch)]\n           (if (nil? val)\n             (doseq [m (vals @mults)]\n               (close!
