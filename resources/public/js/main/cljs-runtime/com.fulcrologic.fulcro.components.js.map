This is set automatically if you use a component to call this function.\n  - `:component` - React element. Set automatically if you call this function using a component.\n  - `:refresh` - Vector containing idents (of components) and keywords (of props). Things that have changed and should be re-rendered\n    on screen. Only necessary when the underlying rendering algorithm won't auto-detect, such as when UI is derived from the\n    state of other components or outside of the directly queried props. Interpretation depends on the renderer selected:\n    The ident-optimized render treats these as \\\"extras\\\".\n  - `:only-refresh` - Vector of idents/keywords.  If the underlying rendering configured algorithm supports it: The\n    components using these are the *only* things that will be refreshed in the UI.\n    This can be used to avoid the overhead of looking for stale data when you know exactly what\n    you want to refresh on screen as an extra optimization. Idents are *not* checked against queries.\n  - `:abort-id` - An ID (you make up) that makes it possible (if the plugins you're using support it) to cancel\n    the network portion of the transaction (assuming it has not already completed).\n  - `:compressible?` - boolean. Check compressible-transact! docs.\n  - `:synchronous?` - boolean. When turned on the transaction will run immediately on the calling thread. If run against\n  a component then the props will be immediately tunneled back to the calling component, allowing for React (raw) input\n  event handlers to behave as described in standard React Forms docs (uses setState behind the scenes). Any remote operations\n  will still be queued as normal. Calling `transact!!` is a shorthand for this option. WARNING: ONLY the given component will\n  be refreshed in the UI. If you have dependent data elsewhere in the UI you must either use `transact!` or schedule\n  your own global render using `app/schedule-render!`.\n  - `:after-render?` - Wait until the next render completes before allowing this transaction to run. This can be used\n  when calling `transact!` from *within* another mutation to ensure that the effects of the current mutation finish\n  before this transaction takes control of the CPU. This option defaults to `false`, but `defmutation` causes it to\n  be set to true for any transactions run within mutation action sections. You can affect the default for this value\n  in a dynamic scope by binding `rc/*after-render*` to true\n  - `:parallel?` - Boolean. If true, the mutation(s) in the transaction will NOT go into a network queue, nor\n    will it block later mutations or queries.\n\n  You may add any additional keys to the option map (namespaced is ideal), and any value is legal in the options\n  map, including functions. The options will appear in the `env` of all mutations run in the transaction as\n  `:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tx-processing/options`. This is the preferred way of passing things like\n  lambdas (if you wanted something like a callback) to mutations. Note that mutation symbols are perfectly legal\n  as mutation *arguments*, so chaining mutations can already be done via the normal transaction mechanism, and\n  callbacks, while sometimes necessary/useful, should be limited to usages where there is no other clean way\n  to accomplish the goal.\n\n  NOTE: This function calls the application's `tx!` function (which is configurable).
