legacy reasons it is the default)\n  in favor of using hooks with helpers like `use-component`.\n\n  General usage:\n\n  1. Set this nses `render!` as your application's optimized render function.\n  2. Create a class that follows all of the normal rules for a Fulcro root (no ident, has initial state,\n  composes children queries/initial-state, etc.\n     a. Add mount/unmount register/deregister calls\n  2. Use floating-root-factory to generate a Fulcro factory, or floating-root-react-class to generate\n  a vanilla React wrapper class that renders the new root.\n     a. Use the factory in normal Fuclro rendering, but don't pass it props, or\n     b. Use `(dom/create-element ReactClass)` to render the vanilla wrapper, or\n     c.
